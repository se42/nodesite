                h2 About Me
                p.flow-text.
                    Jr. Web Developer/Software Engineer
                p.flow-text.
                    Got bored at work and taught myself how to code
                p.flow-text.
                    Goal is to deliver complete web apps on Linux
                p.
                    Growing up I was always your typical math and science kid, so
                    when I got into Georgia Tech it was an easy decision to go.
                    I majored in biochemistry but didn't think a PhD was right for
                    me at the time, so I went to Duke for the Master of Engineering
                    Management program and then worked for 5 years as the operations
                    manager in a small company building analytical scientific instruments.
                p.
                    Eventually I got pretty bored placing purchase orders and monitoring
                    inventory levels.  I kept hearing the engineers talking about
                    Python this and Python that, and since it sounded cool I secretly
                    started to teach myself about this Python thing.  At first it was
                    just the CodeCademy course, then it was a Udemy data science course,
                    then I started messing around with Django, then I started messing
                    around with Linux, and now I'm past the point of no return, deep
                    into the rabbit hole that is computer science.  And I love it.
                p.
                    Over the summer in 2016, I took some time off to
                    really commit to a new career, and at the end of August I started
                    my first job as a Jr. Software Engineer in a small biotech startup.
                    I learned a lot on my own over the summer, but working in a
                    professional environment has really inspired me to keep pushing
                    to see how far I can go with this new career.  I'm also an Ironman
                    finisher, so a big part of this is challenging myself to see how
                    far I can go.  That's something I never felt in operations management.
                p.
                    My goal now is to be able to deliver complete web applications
                    on Linux systems, so my interests lie in everything from system
                    configuration and devops to application code to producing a functional
                    UI, although Iâ€™m definitely not a designer.  That's why I built this
                    site more or less from scratch&mdash;it might not look like much,
                    but it's hopefully going to be an awesome place to do cool things
                    on the internet.
