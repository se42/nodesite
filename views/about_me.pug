                p.lead
                    | My name is Scott Edwards and I'm a Jr. Software Engineer.
                p.lead
                    | I got bored in my old job and taught myself how to program.

                p
                    | Growing up I was always your typical math and science kid, so
                    | when I got into Georgia Tech it was the easiest decision of my
                    | life to go.  I majored in biochemistry but didn't think a PhD
                    | was right for me at the time, so I went to Duke for the Master
                    | of Engineering Management program and then worked for 5 years
                    | as the operations manager in a small company building analytical
                    | scientific instruments.
                p
                    | Eventually I got pretty bored placing purchase orders and monitoring
                    | inventory levels.  I kept hearing the engineers talking about
                    | Python this and Python that, and since it sounded cool I secretly
                    | started to teach myself about this Python thing.  At first it was
                    | just the CodeCademy course, then it was a Udemy data science course,
                    | then I started messing around with Django, then I started messing
                    | around with Linux, and now I'm past the point of no return, deep
                    | into the rabbit hole that is computer science.  And I love it.
                p
                    | Over the summer in 2016, I took some time off to
                    | really commit to a new career, and at the end of August I started
                    | my first job as a Jr. Software Engineer in a small biotech startup.
                    | I learned a lot on my own over the summer, but working in a
                    | professional environment has really inspired me to keep pushing
                    | to see how far I can go with this new career.  I'm also an Ironman
                    | finisher, so a big part of this is challenging myself to see how
                    | far I can go.  That's something I never felt in operations management.
                p
                    | My goal now is to be able to deliver complete web applications
                    | on Linux systems, so my interests lie in everything from system
                    | configuration and devops to application code to producing a functional
                    | UI, although Iâ€™m definitely not a designer.  That's why I built this
                    | site more or less from scratch&mdash;it might not look like much,
                    | but it's hopefully going to be an awesome place to do cool things
                    | on the internet.
